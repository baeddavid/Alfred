* Overview
HL7 FHIR is a standard for exchaning healthcare information electronically. It is a moden, web-based stanard developed by Health Level Seven International(HL7) an organization that develops standards
for health care exchange.

FHIR is designed to facilitate interoperability and exchange of healthcare data between different healthcare systems, devices, and applications. It uses a modular appraoch and leverages modern web technologies
such as RESTful APIs and JSON for data representation.

The key goals of HL7 FHIR include:
 1. Interoperability: FHIR aims to enable seamless data exchange between various healthcare systems, allowing different stakeholders to access and share healthcare information effectively.
 2. Standardization: FHIR provides a standardized format for representing healthcare data, ensuring consistency and compatability across different systems.
 3. Flexibility: FHIR allows for incremental adoption, meaning that healthcare organizations can start small and gradually expand their implementations without disrupting existing systems.
 4. Easy Implementation: FHIR utilizes modern web technologies and follows a simplified approach, making it easier to develop and implement FHIR-based applications and such.
